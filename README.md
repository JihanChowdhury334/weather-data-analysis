# üåç Climate Data Analysis in C (1750‚Äì2015)

Analyze real-world climate records spanning from **1750 to 2015** using C and GNUPlot.  
This project demonstrates importing large CSV datasets, computing averages, identifying extremes, and generating clear visualizations of temperature trends over centuries.

## üöÄ Features & Functionality
- **Data Import & Parsing**
  - Reads global temperature data from `GlobalTemperatures.csv`.  
  - Extracts year, month, mean temperature, max, min, uncertainty, and ocean values.  

- **Yearly & Century Averages**
  - Computes yearly averages from 1760‚Äì2015.  
  - Aggregates century-wise averages for 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.  

- **Monthly Trends**
  - Calculates average temperature for each month (Jan‚ÄìDec).  
  - Evaluates patterns across decades and modern years.  

- **Temperature Extremes**
  - Identifies hottest and coldest **months** in the dataset.  
  - Tracks hottest and coldest **years**.  

- **Comparisons & Visualizations**
  - 19th vs 20th century yearly trends (century_19_20.txt).  
  - Annual averages with min/max bands (Q8).  
  - Century-wise min/max/avg comparisons (Q9).  
  - Monthly averages with uncertainty (Q10).  
  - Land vs ocean averages (Q11).  

- **Graphing with GNUPlot**
  - Includes scripts (`#6_graph_code.gnu` ‚Üí `#11.gnu`) for generating line graphs, comparative charts, and uncertainty plots.  
  - Visualizes historical trends and modern climate shifts with clarity.

## üß† What I Practiced & Learned
- **C Programming**
  - File handling with `fopen`, `fgets`, and `sscanf`.  
  - Arrays for aggregating yearly, monthly, and century data.  
  - Structured modular logic for multiple statistical outputs.  

- **Data Analysis Concepts**
  - Averaging over different timescales.  
  - Tracking extremes (hottest/coldest values).  
  - Handling incomplete or uncertain data.  

- **GNUPlot**
  - Automating scientific plotting with `.gnu` scripts.  
  - Comparing datasets with multi-line graphs.  
  - Highlighting trends with error/uncertainty visualization.  

- **Project Workflow**
  - Parsing CSVs into usable structures.  
  - Writing results into multiple `.txt` files.  
  - Feeding outputs into GNUPlot for visualization.
